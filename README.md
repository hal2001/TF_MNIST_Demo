# TF_MNIST_Demo

This notebook demonstrates how to use the new Tensorflow 1.0 API from
Google to classify the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. More
information about TensorFlow can be found at
https://www.tensorflow.org/. This demo is heavily based on material
presented by Dandelion Mané (of Google) at the TensorFlow Dev Summit
2017 in his excellent talk: Hands-on TensorBoard
